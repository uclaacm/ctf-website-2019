          <p>Capture the Flag is a security hackathon - which means youâ€™ll actually be hacking! Participants compete against other student teams. The event is open to students of all skill levels and we are especially beginner friendly. The goal is to capture a flag hidden in the solution of a challenging question. The more difficult a question, the more points your team is awarded for "capturing" that particular flag.</p>
